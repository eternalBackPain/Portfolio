# John Naoom

Hello. I'm a rising legal professional (i.e. overzealous law student) with an interest in tech. 

Welcome to my site.

## Background

I work as a paralegal for a tier-one construction and development company. I've also clerked at an upper-mid tier law firm, rotating through the construction and public law practices.

Prior to entering the legal industry, I:
- cooked at Maccas; 
- served at Target;
- merchandised goods for a bit;
- started bartending and pulling coffee shots (not the best barista admittedly);
- interned in not-for-profit shareholder advocacy; and
- sat in display homes to sell new home builds.

## Interests

I'm an avid programmer. I'm decent at web development (JavaScript, Node.js) and want to learn more about AI and Web3 dev. Check out [GitHub](https://github.com/eternalBackPain) for my projects.

I have a background in economics, and particularly enjoy econometrics (using statistics to study relationships between variables and making predictions). 

I also enjoy:
- watching terrible low budget horror films on Amazon Prime;
- financially destroying my friends in Monopoly;
- logging my runs on strava and detailing my every thought in the description box; and
- cooking, especially noodle dishes, curries and hummus (baking soda and ice - iykyk).
